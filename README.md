This project solve some basic banking system problem
Case Study: Banking System Problem: The banking system is facing a lot of errors and exceptions due to incorrect inputs and output operations. As a developer, you have been given the task to design a Java solution that will handle all these errors and exceptions.

Java Solution:

To design a Java solution for banking systems, we will use interfaces to handle user inputs and outputs. We will also design UML diagrams for better understanding and error handling.

Interfaces: We will create the following interfaces to handle user inputs and outputs:

InputInterface: This interface will handle all user inputs such as account numbers, transaction details, and other account-related information.
OutputInterface: This interface will handle all outputs such as transaction status, account balances, and other account-related information.

UML Diagrams: We will use UML diagrams to design a better banking system. The following are the UML diagrams that we will use:

Class Diagram: This diagram will show the relation between classes, interfaces, and other objects used in the system.
Sequence Diagram: This diagram will show how different objects interact with each other at different stages of the transaction.

Error Handling: We will handle errors and exceptions using the try-catch block. The following are the errors that we will handle:

Wrong Account Number: If a user enters a wrong account number, we will throw an error and ask them to enter the correct account number.
Insufficient Balance: If a user tries to withdraw more money than their account balance, we will throw an error and ask them to enter a lower amount.
Server Error: If there is any server error, we will send an error message to the user and request them to try again later.

Conclusion: A well-designed Java solution for a banking system will use interfaces and UML diagrams to handle user inputs and outputs, as well as to manage errors and exceptions. By handling errors and exceptions appropriately, we can make sure that users have a seamless and error-free banking experience.
